    """A threaded class to compute an impact scenario.

        Under python a thread can only be run once, so the instances
        based on this class are designed to be short lived.

        We inherit from QObject so that we can use Qt translation self.tr
        calls and emit signals.

       .. todo:: implement this class using QThread as a base class since it
          supports thread termination which python threading doesnt seem to do.
          Also see the techbase article below for emitting signals across
          threads using Qt.QueuedConnection.

          Python_introduction_to_signals_and_slots

       Users of this of this class can listen for signals indicating
       when processing is done. For example::

         from is_impact_calculator_thread import ImpactCalculatorThread
         n = ImpactCalculatorThread()
         n.done.connect(n.showMessage)
         n.done.emit()

       Prints 'hello' to the console
