"""Module for 2D interpolation over a rectangular mesh

This module

* provides piecewise constant (nearest neighbour) and bilinear interpolation
* is fast (based on numpy vector operations)
* depends only on numpy
* guarantees that interpolated values never exceed the four nearest neighbours
* handles missing values in domain sensibly using NaN
* is unit tested with a range of common and corner cases

        x: 1D array of x-coordinates of the mesh on which to interpolate
        y: 1D array of y-coordinates of the mesh on which to interpolate
        Z: 2D array of values for each x, y pair

            * 'linear' - bilinear interpolation using the four
              nearest neighbours (default)

        bounds_error: Boolean flag. If True (default) an exception will
                      be raised when interpolated values are requested

    Output
        1D array with same length as points with interpolated values

    Notes
        Input coordinates x and y are assumed to be monotonically increasing,
        but need not be equidistantly spaced.

        Z is assumed to have dimension M x N, where M = len(x) and N = len(y).
        In other words it is assumed that the x values follow the first
        (vertical) axis downwards and y values the second (horizontal) axis
        from left to right.

        If this routine is to be used for interpolation of raster grids where
        data is typically organised with longitudes (x) going from left to
        right and latitudes (y) from left to right then user

"""
Bilinear interpolation is based on the standard 1D linear interpolation
formula:

Given points (x0, y0) and (x1, x0) and a value of x where x0 <= x <= x1,
the linearly interpolated value y at x is given as

alpha*(y1-y0) + y0

or

alpha*y1 + (1-alpha)*y0                (1)

where alpha = (x-x0)/(x1-x0)           (1a)


2D bilinear interpolation aims at obtaining an interpolated value z at a point
(x,y) which lies inside a square formed by points (x0, y0), (x1, y0),
(x0, y1) and (x1, y1) for which values z00, z10, z01 and z11 are known.

This obtained be first applying equation (1) twice in in the x-direction
to obtain interpolated points q0 and q1 for (x, y0) and (x, y1), respectively.

q0 = alpha*z10 + (1-alpha)*z00         (2)

and

q1 = alpha*z11 + (1-alpha)*z01         (3)


Then using equation (1) in the y-direction on the results from (2) and (3)

z = beta*q1 + (1-beta)*q0              (4)

where beta = (y-y0)/(y1-y0)            (4a)


Substituting (2) and (3) into (4) yields

z = alpha*beta*z11 + beta*z01 - alpha*beta*z01 +
    alpha*z10 + z00 - alpha*z00 - alpha*beta*z10 - beta*z00 +
    alpha*beta*z00
  = alpha*beta*(z11 - z01 - z10 + z00) +
    alpha*(z10 - z00) + beta*(z01 - z00) + z00

which can be further simplified to

z = alpha*beta*(z11 - dx - dy - z00) + alpha*dx + beta*dy + z00  (5)

where
dx = z10 - z00
dy = z01 - z00

Equation (5) is what is implemented in the function interpolate2d above.


Piecewise constant interpolation can be implemented using the same coefficients
(1a) and (4a) that are used for bilinear interpolation as they are a measure of
the relative distance to the left and lower neigbours. A value of 0 will pick
the left or lower bound whereas a value of 1 will pick the right or higher
bound. Hence z can be assigned to its nearest neigbour as follows

    | z00   alpha < 0.5 and beta < 0.5    # lower left corner
    |
    | z10   alpha >= 0.5 and beta < 0.5   # lower right corner
z = |
    | z01   alpha < 0.5 and beta >= 0.5   # upper left corner
    |
    | z11   alpha >= 0.5 and beta >= 0.5  # upper right corner
