"""Module for 1D interpolation

This module
* provides piecewise constant (nearest neighbour) and bilinear interpolation
* is fast (based on numpy vector operations)
* depends only on numpy
* guarantees that interpolated values never exceed the two nearest neighbours
* handles missing values in domain sensibly using NaN
* is unit tested with a range of common and corner cases

See interpolation2d.py for documentation of the mathematical derivation used.

        x: 1D array of x-coordinates on which to interpolate
        z: 1D array of values for each x
        points: 1D array of coordinates where interpolated values are sought
        mode: Determines the interpolation order. Options are
              'constant' - piecewise constant nearest neighbour interpolation

                         nearest neighbours (default)

        Input coordinates x are assumed to be monotonically increasing,

"""
Bilinear interpolation is based on the standard 1D linear interpolation
formula:

Given points (x0, y0) and (x1, x0) and a value of x where x0 <= x <= x1,
the linearly interpolated value y at x is given as

alpha*(y1-y0) + y0

or

alpha*y1 + (1-alpha)*y0                (1)

where alpha = (x-x0)/(x1-x0)           (1a)


Piecewise constant interpolation can be implemented using the same coefficients
(1a) that are used for bilinear interpolation as they are a measure of
the relative distance to the left and lower neigbours. A value of 0 will pick
the lower bound whereas a value of 1 will pick the higher bound.
Hence z can be assigned to its nearest neigbour as follows

    | z0   alpha < 0.5    # lower value
z = |
    | z1   alpha >= 0.5   # higher value
