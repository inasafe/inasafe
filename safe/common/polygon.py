    """Determine whether points are inside or outside a polygon.

    Args:
        * points: Tuple of (x, y) coordinates, or list of tuples
        * polygon: list or Nx2 array of polygon vertices
        * polygon_bbox: (optional) bounding box for polygon
        * closed: (optional) determine whether points on boundary should be
              regarded as belonging to the polygon (closed = True)
              or not (closed = False). If None, boundary is left undefined,
              i.e. some points on boundary may be deemed to be inside while
              others may be deemed to be outside. This options makes
              the code faster.
        * check_input: Allows faster execution if set to False
        * use_numpy: Use the fast numpy implementation

    Returns:
        * indices_inside_polygon: array of indices of points
              falling inside the polygon
        * indices_outside_polygon: array of indices of points
              falling outside the polygon

    Raises: A generic Exception is raised for unexpected input.

    Example:

        U = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [0,1]]  # Unit square
        separate_points_by_polygon( [[0.5, 0.5], [1, -0.5], [0.3, 0.2]], U)

        will return the indices [0, 2, 1] and count == 2 as only the first
        and the last point are inside the unit square

    Remarks:
        The vertices may be listed clockwise or counterclockwise and
        the first point may optionally be repeated.
        Polygons do not need to be convex.
        Polygons can have holes in them and points inside a hole is
        regarded as being outside the polygon.
