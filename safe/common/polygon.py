    Input:

       polygon - list or Nx2 array of polygon vertices
       closed - (optional) determine whether points on boundary should be
       regarded as belonging to the polygon (closed = True)
       or not (closed = False)
       check_input: Allows faster execution if set to False
       use_numpy: Use the fast numpy implementation

    Output:
       indices: array of same length as points with indices of points falling
       inside the polygon listed from the beginning and indices of points
       falling outside listed from the end.

       count: count of points falling inside the polygon

       The indices of points inside are obtained as indices[:count]
       The indices of points outside are obtained as indices[count:]

    Examples:
       U = [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [0,1]]  # Unit square

       separate_points_by_polygon( [[0.5, 0.5], [1, -0.5], [0.3, 0.2]], U)
       will return the indices [0, 2, 1] and count == 2 as only the first
       and the last point are inside the unit square

    Remarks:
       The vertices may be listed clockwise or counterclockwise and
       the first point may optionally be repeated.
       Polygons do not need to be convex.
       Polygons can have holes in them and points inside a hole is
       regarded as being outside the polygon.
