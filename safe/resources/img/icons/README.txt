Artwork for the icons used in InaSAFE consists of both original works by
InaSAFE project members and adapted icons from the 'iconic' free icon set,
available under the GPL at http://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/

Please use an optimiser service such as http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-editor/
with extreme compression mode to reduce the icon sizes to as small as possible.
