    """Indonesian Earthquake Fatality Model.

    This model was developed by Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) and
    implemented by Dr. Hadi Ghasemi, Geoscience Australia.


    Reference:

    Indonesian Earthquake Building-Damage and Fatality Models and
    Post Disaster Survey Guidelines Development,
    Bali, 27-28 February 2012, 54pp.


    Algorithm:

    In this study, the same functional form as Allen (2009) is adopted
    to express fatality rate as a function of intensity (see Eq. 10 in the
    report). The Matlab built-in function (fminsearch) for  Nelder-Mead
    algorithm was used to estimate the model parameters. The objective
    function (L2G norm) that is minimised during the optimisation is the
    same as the one used by Jaiswal et al. (2010).

    The coefficients used in the indonesian model are
    x=0.62275231, y=8.03314466, zeta=2.15

    Caveats and limitations:

    The current model is the result of the above mentioned workshop and
    reflects the best available information. However, the current model
    has a number of issues listed below and is expected to evolve further
    over time.

    1 - The model is based on limited number of observed fatality
        rates during 4 past fatal events.
    2 - The model clearly over-predicts the fatality rates at
        intensities higher than VIII.
    3 - The model only estimates the expected fatality rate for a given
        intensity level; however the associated uncertainty for the proposed
        model is not addressed.
    4 - There are few known mistakes in developing the current model:
        - rounding MMI values to the nearest 0.5,
        - Implementing Finite-Fault models of candidate events, and
        - consistency between selected GMPEs with those in use by BMKG.
          These issues will be addressed by ITB team in the final report.

    Note: Because of these caveats, decisions should not be made solely on
    the information presented here and should always be verified by ground
    truthing and other reliable information sources.
