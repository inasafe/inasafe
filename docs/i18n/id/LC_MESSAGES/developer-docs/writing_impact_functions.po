"In many cases, there is a need to tag the exposure layer with values from "
"the hazard layer in order to calculate the impact. Typical examples include "
"interpolation from gridded hazard data to point data (interpolation), from "
"polygon hazard data to point data or, indeed, from polygon data to gridded "
"population data. InaSAFE provides one general mechanism for this purpose "
"called ``assign_hazard_values_to_exposure_data''and it is typically called "
"in the beginning of the impact function to generate an intermediate layer "
"that has all information about both hazard and exposure. A call looks like:"

"In this case H could be either raster or polygon vector data and E polygon "
"or point vector data. In either case the result I represents the exposure "
"data but with an additional attribute added containing the hazard level. If "
"H is polygon data, all its attributes will be transferred to I. If H is "
"raster_data and hence has only one value, that value will be assigned to a "
"new attribute in I as specified by the keyword argument attribute_name - in "
"this example 'depth'. See full documentation of this function in section "
":ref:`data_types`."
