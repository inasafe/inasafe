msgid "InaSAFE is a plugin for QGIS software. It aims to produce realistic natural hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and response activities, using hazard and exposure geographic data. A user’s manual developed by Ole Moeller Nielsen and Tim Sutton complements this short training material. During this training, you will explore the different components of InaSAFE plugin and their usage for an easy-to-use risk and impact scenarios assessments. A data sample will be provided with the present material to give you the ability to learn how to manipulate data in InaSAFE, what the requirements of the data are and what kind of results you can expect out of the data."
