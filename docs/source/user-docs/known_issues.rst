Known Issues
============



Population density grids must be in geographic coordinates
----------------------------------------------------------

Currently, if population density grids are projected they won't
be scaled correctly if resampled.

Help documentation has no style under windows
---------------------------------------------

Currently if you open the help documentation for InaSAFE, not 
styling is applied and images may not show, so it looks rather plain.
We are working to fix this in a future release.
