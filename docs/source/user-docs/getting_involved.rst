Getting involved
================

If you like the work we are doing in InaSAFE and would like to contribute,
we will welcome your involvement. We spend a lot of time and effort trying to
make a robust, user friendly and useful software platform, but there is
no substitute for having interested users participating and sharing their
needs, problems and successes! Here are a few simple ways you can get involved:

**Visit our web site!** The web site will always represent the latest
information on how to use InaSAFE. We encourage anyone who wants to get
involved with the project to first read the content available on the site to
familiarise themselves with the content. The website is available at:

http://inasafe.org


**Join our mailing list!** If you would like to discuss methodologies, using
the software or any issues you encounter, you can join our google group (you
do not need a google account to use this forum) by sending an email to:

inasafe-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com

You can unsubscribe again at any time by simply sending an email to:


inasafe-users+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com

**Use our issue tracker!** We maintain an issue tracker here:

http://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues

On this page you can browse and search existing issues and create new issues.
The issue tracker is a great place to let us know about specific bugs you
encounter or tell us about new features you would like to see in the software.

**Chat live to developers on IRC!** Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a chat room
environment where you can talk (by typing messages) to other inasafe users and
developers to discuss ideas and get help. You can use your own IRC client and
join #inasafe on the irc.freenode.net network. Alternatively, you can use your
web browser to join the chat room using the link below:

http://webchat.freenode.net/

On the form that appears, choose a user name, enter #inasafe in the :guilabel:`
Channels:` box and complete the rest of the details in the form. After logging
in wait a few moments and you will be take to the #inasafe channel.

.. note:: Other people in the room may not be actively watching the channel,
   so just ask your question and leave the chat window open and check back
   every now and then until you see other chat room members become active.

**Submit your code!** We would really like to emphasise that InaSAFE is Free
and Open Source. That means anyone (or any organisation) can freely modify,
adapt and improve the software. We will welcome any contributions to InaSAFE.
The easiest way to do this is to `fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_
the InaSAFE code base on GitHub and then send us a
`pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_.

We also welcome small improvements, translations or other fixes via the issue
management system mentioned above.

.. note:: We have strict requirements that all code submitted to InaSAFE is
   properly :doc:`/developer-docs/coding_standards` compliant and is unit tested. We have this
   requirement in place to ensure a good experience for our users and to
   ensure that users can have confidence in the results produced by InaSAFE.
