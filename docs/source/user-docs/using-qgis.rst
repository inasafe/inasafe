==========
Using QGIS
==========

|project_name| uses `Quantum GIS (QGIS)<http://qgis.org>`- as the platform on 
which to provide its functionality. QGIS itself has good documentation and 
a very helpful user community. In this section we focus on those aspects of
QGIS functionality that will be helpful to someone wanting to carry out
impact scenario assessments using |project_name|.

Things to cover (suggested by Trias Aditya)

- access to statistics data
- access to WFS (for exposure data)
- access to WMS (for background data)
- you have got an idea to access WCS (e.g. hazard, elevation data etc)
- map the projected impact into graphical charts (this will be my
  favourites then...)
