changelog=
        3.0.0
        New features:
        * New wizard for impact function centric analysis.
        * Removed impact function browser.
        * Simplified the toolbar - remaining functionality is still available in Plugins->InaSAFE menu.
        * Impact reports are now nicely styled in PDF outputs.
        Architectural changes:
        * Combined safe and safe_qgis into one package.
        * We now use one translation system instead of two (gettext was dropped).
        * UI files are dynamically compiled at run time so we don't need to ship the uic compiled versions.
        * We no longer user Qt resources so you no longer need to compile with pyrcc.
        * Plugin reloader works again because we fixed the import management that caused it to break.
        * Removed a lot of moribund / experimental / test code that is not used in production.
        * Removed the use of api.py and abstraction between Qt/QGIS based code and console only code.
        Note:
        * This release breaks API comptibility with 2.x releases.
