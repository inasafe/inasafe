    Version 4.0.0
    - Complete overhaul of the InaSAFE code base
    - Deprecated numpy / matrix based geometry manipulation
    - New reporting system including Jinja2 support
    - Experimental support for Infographics
    - Removed all impact functions in favour of a shared workflow for all hazards
    - Added support for exposure specfic thresholds in hazard metadata
    - Produce rich data outputs instead of simple HTML reports
    - Added new hazard support for Tropical Cyclone
    - Extensive updates to the help reference and a new help browser
    - Removal of all logic that uses interpolation to assess impact level
    - Application of standards to reporting and calculations for more consistent presentation
    - Ability to work with larger datasets in many cases (just be patient while analysis runs)
    - Speed ups and improvements to many parts of the code base
    - Improvements to the batch runner tool
    - Improvements to the shake grid importer tool
    - Port of the minimum needs tool to use our new architecture
    - Added support for analysis of irregular areas (as defined by aggregation layer)
    - Features or population outside of aggregation areas are no longer counted as part of the total exposure count
    - Added support for working with data subsets
    - Analysis no longer works only with local file sources
    - All geometry operations are performed using the QGIS API now
    - QGIS layers list items now have a context menu for InaSAFE
    - Input layers no longer need to be in EPSG:4326
    - Moved realtime code to its own repository
    - Improved error handling system
    - Added profiling for all analysis steps so we can easily identify performance bottlenecks
    - Improved how partial overlaps with a hazard are managed (feature is assigned highest impact zone)
    - Generate rich provenance for use in reporting
    - Generate multiple sub products (impact layer, aggregation by hazard layer)
    - PDF Reports are generated directly once analysis completes
    - Earthquake sub-algorithm selection has been moved to the InaSAFE options dialog
    - ITB Bayesian algorithm is now default for earthquake
    - Earthquake analysis map output is now a boolean layer indicating if a cell contains displaced people
    - Many, many more improvements...
