        Bug fix: Added missing minimum needs profiles.
        2.2.0
        New features:
        * New extent selector tool to let you specify precise analysis areas
        * New minimum needs manager with support for regional minimum needs profiles
        * Keywords data is now written / read as ISO19115 metadata instead of our own keywords format
        * New generic categories impact function for hazards that uses classes e.g. low / medium / high
        * New volcano OpenStreetMap buildings impact function
        * New flood on OpenStreetMap buildings impact function
        * More precise clipping to raster pixel boundaries to prevent pixel shifts

        * Make update-translations is unreliable at detecting new strings #348
        * Clipped raster data has different resolution to original raster data #344
        * Ordered dictionary is part of python 2.7 we ship our own (untested) #341
        * Need test for presence of polygon_id in points clipped by polygon #333
        * CANVAS.layers() doesn't include the impact layer and other generated layers #306
