        Bug fix: Added missing minimum needs profiles.
        2.2.0
        New features:
        * New extent selector tool to let you specify precise analysis areas
        * New minimum needs manager with support for regional minimum needs profiles
        * Keywords data is now written / read as ISO19115 metadata instead of our own keywords format
        * New generic categories impact function for hazards that uses classes e.g. low / medium / high
        * New volcano OpenStreetMap buildings impact function
        * New flood on OpenStreetMap buildings impact function
        * More precise clipping to raster pixel boundaries to prevent pixel shifts
