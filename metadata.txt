# Optional items:

changelog=
    Complete overhaul of the InaSAFE code base
    Deprecated numpy / matrix based geometry manipulation
    New reporting system including Jinja2 support
    Experimental support for Infographics
    Removed all impact functions in favour of a shared workflow for all hazards
    Added support for exposure specfic thresholds in hazard metadata
    Produce rich data outputs instead of simple HTML reports
    Added new hazard support for Tropical Cyclone
    Extensive updates to the help reference and a new help browser
    Removal of all logic that uses interpolation to assess impact level
    Application of standards to reporting and calculations for more consistent presentation
    Ability to work with larger datasets in many cases (just be patient while analysis runs)
    Speed ups and improvements to many parts of the code base
    Improvements to the batch runner tool
    Improvements to the shake grid importer tool
    Port of the minimum needs tool to use our new architecture
    Added support for analysis of irregular areas (as defined by aggregation layer)
    Features or population outside of aggregation areas are no longer counted as part of the total exposure count
    Added support for working with data subsets
    Analysis no longer works only with local file sources
    All geometry operations are performed using the QGIS API now
    QGIS layers list items now have a context menu for InaSAFE
    Input layers no longer need to be in EPSG:4326
    Moved realtime code to its own repository
    Improved error handling system
    Added profiling for all analysis steps so we can easily identify performance bottlenecks
    Improved how partial overlaps with a hazard are managed (feature is assigned highest impact zone)
    Generate rich provenance for use in reporting
    Generate multiple sub products (impact layer, aggregation by hazard layer)
    PDF Reports are generated directly once analysis completes
    Earthquake sub-algorithm selection has been moved to the InaSAFE options dialog
    ITB Bayesian algorithm is now default for earthquake
    Earthquake analysis map output is now a boolean layer indicating if a cell contains displaced people
    Many, many more improvements...
