Limitations
===========

InaSAFE is a new project. The current code development started in
earnest in January 2012 and there is still much to be done.  However,
we work on the philosophy that stakeholders should have access to the
development and source code from the very beginning and invite
comments, suggestions and contributions.  See
`our milestones list <https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/milestones>`_ and
`our open issues list <https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues?page=1&state=open>`_ 
for known bugs and outstanding tasks.
