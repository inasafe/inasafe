### Problem

```
Copy/paste some InaSAFE logs here if it was an error.
```

<!---
Logs in QGIS are available in the bottom right corner on the bubble icon.
Then open the InaSAFE tab and copy/paste some logs.
-->

### Expected Behaviour

### Environment
* InaSAFE : 
* QGIS : 
* OS : 
<!---
Filenames and paths so as to reproduce locally, a project is better.
It's nice if you can provide a ZIP with data in the ticket (drag and drop your zip on this textbox).
-->
* Data used :
  * Exposure : 
  * Hazard : 
  * Aggregation :
  * Extent : 
  
Checklist: <!--- if applicable -->
<!---
Replace the space between square brackets by a `x` to make it checked.
By running the analysis in debug mode, you may have some different errors.
-->
* [ ] Did you try to run it in debug mode ?
* [ ] Is the data available ?
  * If yes, where (BTSync, data.inasafe.org, zip) ? 

### Proposed Solution
