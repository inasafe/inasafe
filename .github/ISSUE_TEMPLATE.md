### Problem

```
Copy/paste some InaSAFE logs here if it was an error.
```

### Expected Behaviour

### Environment
* InaSAFE : 
* QGIS : 
* OS : 
* Data used (filenames and paths so as to reproduce, a project is better):
  * Exposure : 
  * Hazard : 
  * Aggregation :
  * Extent : 
  
Checklist (if applicable): 
* [ ] Did you try to run it in debug mode ?
* [ ] Is the data available ?
  * If yes, where (BTSync, data.inasafe.org, zip) ? 

### Proposed Solution
