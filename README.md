System Requirements
-------------------

 - A standard PC with at least 4GB of RAM running Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
 - The QGIS Open Source Geographic Information System (http://www.qgis.org).
   Although InaSAFE will probably run on any version of QGIS version above 2.0
   or newer, our supported version is the latest Long Term Release version
   of QGIS.

History
=======

* In March 2011, Risk In A Box (the predecessor to InaSAFE) was built as a web 
  application running as a GeoNode Plugin.
* InaSAFE development as a QGIS plugin started in January 2012.
* In October 2012, version 1.0 of InaSAFE was launched at the [5th Asian ministerial conference on disaster risk reduction (AMCDRR)](
  http://www.unisdr.org/we/inform/events/23540) where it was demonstrated to 
  the then president of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono who praised the project.
* On 30 Jan 2013, InaSAFE was awarded the prestigious [Black Duck Open Source.
  Rookie of the Year Award] (https://www.blackducksoftware.com/news/releases/black-duck-announces-2012-open-source-rookies-year-winners).
* Version 2.0 of InaSAFE was released in January, 2014.
* Version 3.0 was released in March 2015 which added support
  for using the QGIS API within impact functions.
