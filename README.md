=======

InaSAFE is free software that allows disaster managers to study realistic
natural hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and
response activities. InaSAFE is a plugin for [QGIS](http://qgis.org).

For more information about InaSAFE and its documentation please visit [inasafe.org] (http://www.inasafe.org).

The latest source code is available at

Quick Installation Guide
========================

You first need to have [QGIS](http://qgis.org/) installed. Grab your free
copy from [the QGIS download page](http://download/qgis.org).

To install the InaSAFE plugin, use the plugin manager in
[QGIS](http://qgis.org):

  Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins → Get more tab

Then search for "InaSAFE", select it and click the install button.
The plugin will now be added to your plugins menu.

**Note:** You may need to restart QGIS if upgrading from a prior version.


System Requirements
-------------------

 - A standard PC with at least 4GB of RAM running Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
 - The QGIS Open Source Geographic Information System (http://www.qgis.org).
   InaSAFE requires QGIS version 1.7 or newer.

Limitations
===========

InaSAFE is a new project. The current code development started in
earnest in January 2012 and there is still much to be done.  However,
we work under the philosophy that stakeholders should have access to the
development and source code from the very beginning and invite
comments, suggestions and contributions.  See
[our milestones list](https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues/milestones) and
[our open issues list](https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues?page=1&state=open)
for known bugs and outstanding tasks.
